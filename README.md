# Social Network with DDD

This repository is just for studies.\
I was trying to create an domain based on the dependencies.

This repo was not created with TDD,\
I was just thinking about the directories and files structure.

- the user can ´create an account´
- the user will ´receive an welcome mail after create an account´
- the user can ´do login´
- the user can ´do logout´
- the user can ´post a text´
- the user can ´post a photo´
- the user can ´post a video´
- the user can ´see your profile´
- the user can ´see your posts´
- the user can ´search another users´
- the user can ´see another users' profile´
- the user can ´add an user as friend´
- the user can ´see his friends' timeline´
